                    <br><br><p><em>“…this do in remembrance of me.”  1 Corinthians 11:24.</em> On the first day of the week, time is set aside to remember Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection by eating unleavened bread and drinking “the fruit of the vine” (grape juice).  These symbolize Jesus’ body, which was crucified, and His blood, which was shed for the forgiveness of our sins.  <u>Luke 22:14-20</u></p>

                    <br><br><p><em>“…sing unto the Lord, all the earth.”  Psalms 96:1</em> The Lord desires to have His praises sung from the hearts of Christians without the aid of instruments.  God  has designed singing as a way to not only please Him, but to teach and admonish one another.  This is a joyful occasion and brings to our minds the greatness of God.  <u>Ephesians 5:19; Colossians 3:16</u></p>

                <section>
                    <br><br><p><em>“Pray without ceasing.”  1 Thessalonians 5:17. </em> Christians are blessed with an avenue of approaching God.  We come to God by prayer.  Our prayer is made to give thanks and praise to God.  We also pray for each other and for all men.  This is good and acceptable in the sight of God.  <u>1 Timothy 2:1-8</u></p>

                    <br><br><p><em>“…God loves a cheerful giver.”  2 Corinthians 9:7 </em> A pleasant and cheerful duty of the saints, is giving back to the Lord a portion of what He has blessed us with.  A few minutes have been designated to allow the members an opportunity to contribute what they have set aside.  We never solicit funds from our visitors.  <u>1 Corinthians 16:1,2</u></p>

                <section>
                    <br><br><p><em>“How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace…”  Romans 10:15.</em> The Church truly wants to be pleasing to God.  Therefore, we follow the New Testament example of spreading His word and preaching the things of God.  The Apostles ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.  <u>Titus 1:3</u></p>
