                    The Apostles, guided by the Holy Spirit show us the pattern for the church and how Christians should behave in striving to teach only the truth, which is the word of God, not Man's word. 
                    (Jn 14:26, 16:13) (Jn 4:24) (Jn 17:17)<br>
                    In order to accomplish this, we recognize the need to search the Scriptures and to speak only that which is authorized by the word of God.<br> (Acts 17:11) (1Pe 4:11) (Col 3:17)</p>
